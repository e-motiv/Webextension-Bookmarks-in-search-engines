****************** On Publish ******************************
Comment console.log out				([^/;])([;]*)console.log => $1//$2console.log
Change manifest version
Put DONE below in README.md
build
Commit and push files to github
Convert description md to html. (Use existing html)
Update in Firefox via "update addons"

****************** DONE (for release notes before publish and some things into features of description) ******************************

**You have to reset to default options to be able to remember the minimize function. I am sorry.**

Default options changed: 
  - Only searches in exact google url now (www.google.com/search) and not other google sites
  - Included Pocket as search engine (app.getpocket.com/search)
Fixed: Domain, SUbdomain and url filters work on whole url and not on their parts

The results pane now minimizes at the right edge, middle page, show search icons results only
Once minimized, it will remember it forever for the web site that follows the same rule.

Change height of results pane as big as the results page and keep the header fied (experimental)

Some minor style changes


****************** BUGS!!!!!!! ***********************

PoPup still gives old result if new tab, but not completed loading yet
=> onstartload, create or refresh tab, onnacompleted start CS (or not)

when 3 keywords added and 2 also not found, it doesn't go back to 1, so whole sequence doesn't work or oinly when only 1 keyword?

****************** Unresolvable problems ***********************		
		Non bug, but buggy: ecosia finds urls domains without actually being results (e.g. "give me hope" )
			That's because ecosia but domains between <b> tags

		
****************** TODOS ******************************

Check TODO's inline code and put here
-------------------------------------------------------
asked on github and seems interesting: search for same domains (of the urls)
WEBEXTENSIONS don't allow it (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/search#Parameters)

Offer a dark style

Put keywords in toolbar (put this in description) and clicking on them searches in current tab (so we can search in all tabs)
Toolbar stays there until tab gone or search disabled
(Means going through document before bm search? If so, maybe already get urls. Or do it again?


Port to chrome?

MAYBE: Keep the basicresults when already started after typing and reloading after. SHould be done on bg then though...

ONCE: when bg url search fails without promise filas, chain is broken (use timer because t also happens elsewhere!) (see try..catch)
		
ONCE: Make bottom sroll arrow button dissappear when scrolled, and back when scrolled up

ONCE: Give each engine something to speed up search, changeable in options 
	Trial 1: difference when block: between 3.5 en 2.2 s not worthwhile, maybe do different like class "rc" etc..
		
ONCE: Custom colors
		
MAYBE:	Find bookmarks from "searchUrls" back in myView results, color those search results very specially and put on top! If not exist put it there!
	IS this really necessary? As long as we can't edit the bookmark, we just trust the addon and find the info in the engine results

MAYBE: When search engine doesn't refresh but uses ajax, trigger search too!
	Do search engines still do that? SO far not seen

TODO: Give seperate indications for in page url find when whole url or just domain! another color and another star
		CAn't reproduce. Need searchterms that trigger this. Possible not happening and url does exists in bookmarks!
				
WHEN ADDON MORE POPULAR:
-- 
setup donation link on addons page  (bitcoin?) - when firefox addons downloads start to rise only; don't wast your time!
Make a page after update with release notes and donation request, just like session manager does
(check prive planning)
--
Put TODO's on a site with bounties!

NOT NOW: Basic search: search with even less  keywords until results: (e.g. xxx yyy zzzz, no results, search for "xxx yyy" and "yyy zzz", no results "xxx" and "yyy" and "zzz"
	This is very hard logic and probably not neccessary. For now, just one less keyword.


****************** TO REMEMBER ***********************
URL regex find was taken from among other things	-------->	http://benalman.com/code/test/js-linkify/
		
If doing different kind of searches, order them by fastest searches first


Fixed: Marked keywords font color not set by search engines
(keep this comment in "take decisions / to remember")

URL TESTS:
- should not trigger
	- domain filter in path:
