****************** BUGS!!!!!!! ***********************
Url search finds non matches??
	E.G. "javascript array copy minus element" -> www.dyn-web.com/javascript/arrays/remove.php  
		(only domain -> maybe get another color for and another star. But then a help button is needed

Sometimes clicking on the search engine generated links doesn't do anything anymore.
		Fixed?

****************** TODOS ******************************
Check TODO's inline code and put here
---------------------------------------------

TODO: When done for a while on this project, put the rest on site with bounties!
---------------------------------------------

TODO: Basic search: search with even less  keywords until results: (e.g. xxx yyy zzzz, no results, search for "xxx yyy" and "yyy zzz", no results "xxx" and "yyy" and "zzz"
				This is very hard logic and probably not neccessary
				
TODO:	Find bookmarks from "searchUrls" back in myView results, color those search results very specially and put on top! If not exist put it there!

TODO:
setup donation link on addons page  (bitcoin?)
Make a page after update with release notes and donation request, just like session manager does
(patreon?  or paypal? Anyway, ait until virus gone)

TODO: When search engine doesn't refresh but uses ajax, trigger search too!
	Do search engines still do that? SO far not seen

TODO: Do we need to stop content/bg chain and other searches when the page reloads while searching? No way to stop a promis mid-run (ecma 7 maybe)
TODO: CLeanup more on port diconnect

TODO: when bg url search fails without promise filas, chain is broken (use timer because t also happens elsewhere!) (see try..catch)
		
TODO: Make bottom sroll arrow button dissappear when scrolled, and back when scrolled up

TODO: Give each engine something to speed up search, changeable in options 
	Trial 1: difference when block: between 3.5 en 2.2 s not worthwhile, maybe do different like class "rc" etc..


TODO maybe: Add button to manually activate and option for "always on this site?" and "never on this site". If so, replace the current minimize function by it
		3 states: Minimized automatically (no results) or manually minimized manually and noresults (gray?)
		manually minimized with results (gray with star tag?)
		not minimized (results or maximized manually) (color)


****************** TO REMEMBER ***********************
URL regex find was taken from among other things	-------->	http://benalman.com/code/test/js-linkify/
		
If doing different kind of searches, order them by fastest first
