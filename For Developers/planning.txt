****************** BUGS!!!!!!! ***********************

Sometimes clicking on the search engine generated links doesn't do anything anymore.
		Fixed? Not experienced for a long time.
		
		Makes sure subdomain tests subdomein only and not the whole url!! Could be word in path!!
		TODO: "give me hope" on ecosia finds urls domains without actually being results, so distinguis between domain and url find???? or what am i missing here? 
		BUT not on google!!   Hmmm?
		
		boom effect not working anymore??
		
****************** TODOS ******************************

Check TODO's inline code and put here
-------------------------------------------------------

ONCE: when bg url search fails without promise filas, chain is broken (use timer because t also happens elsewhere!) (see try..catch)
		
ONCE: Make bottom sroll arrow button dissappear when scrolled, and back when scrolled up

ONCE: Give each engine something to speed up search, changeable in options 
	Trial 1: difference when block: between 3.5 en 2.2 s not worthwhile, maybe do different like class "rc" etc..
		
ONCE: Custom colors
		
MAYBE:	Find bookmarks from "searchUrls" back in myView results, color those search results very specially and put on top! If not exist put it there!
	IS this really necessary? As long as we can't edit the bookmark, we just trust the addon and find the info in the engine results

MAYBE: When search engine doesn't refresh but uses ajax, trigger search too!
	Do search engines still do that? SO far not seen

TODO: Give seperate indications for in page url find when whole url or just domain! another color and another star
		CAn't reproduce. Need searchterms that trigger this. Possible not happening and url does exists in bookmarks!
				
WHEN ADDON MORE POPULAR:
-- 
setup donation link on addons page  (bitcoin?) - when firefox addons downloads start to rise only; don't wast your time!
Make a page after update with release notes and donation request, just like session manager does
(patreon?  or paypal? Anyway, ait until virus gone)
--
Put TODO's on a site with bounties!

NOT NOW: Basic search: search with even less  keywords until results: (e.g. xxx yyy zzzz, no results, search for "xxx yyy" and "yyy zzz", no results "xxx" and "yyy" and "zzz"
	This is very hard logic and probably not neccessary. For now, just one less keyword.


****************** TO REMEMBER ***********************
URL regex find was taken from among other things	-------->	http://benalman.com/code/test/js-linkify/
		
If doing different kind of searches, order them by fastest searches first


Fixed: Marked keywords font color not set by search engines
(keep this comment in "take decisions / to remember")
